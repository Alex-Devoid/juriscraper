The trial justice held the counterclaim defendants liable for slander of title, finding that notices of lis pendens were maliciously filed by the counterclaim defendants on the four properties at issue in the case. The counterclaim defendants contended that the trial justice erred: (1) when he held that Michael Voccola, in his capacity as executor of the estate of Frederick Carrozza, Jr., Angela Giguere, and Christine Giguere-Carrozza (collectively the counterclaimants) had met the required burden of proof to establish slander of title; (2) when he awarded compensatory damages based on the difference between the highest value of the properties attained during the period of time in which they were subject to the notices of lis pendens and the value of the properties when the notices of lis pendens were removed; (3) when he ruled that prejudgment interest should run from the date on which the notices of lis pendens were filed; (4) when he awarded punitive damages in the amount of $845,000 against Frederick Sr.; and (5) when he held Phillip, Freida, and Laurie liable for slander of title despite the fact that they were not parties to this civil action at the time that the notices of lis pendens were filed in 2002. <br> <br>The Supreme Court held that: (1) the trial justice did not commit clear error or misconceive or overlook material evidence when he held Frederick Sr. liable for slander of title; (2) the trial justice properly computed compensatory damages by subtracting the value of the property on the date the notices of lis pendens were removed from the highest value of the properties attained during the time period in which they were subject to the notices of lis pendens; (3) prejudgment interest should be calculated starting from November 15, 2002, the date of the filing of the notices of lis pendens; (4) the trial justice did not misconceive any evidence in awarding punitive damages against Frederick Sr., but the punitive damages awarded were excessive; and (5) the trial justice properly found Phillip, Freida, and Laurie liable for slander of title. <br> <br>Consequently, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court in part and vacated the portion of that judgment awarding $845,000 in punitive damages.

Bowen’s Landing Corp., 522 A.2d 1222 (R.I. 1987).&nbsp; The plaintiff also contended that a New Shoreham municipal ordinance, which establishes that owners, or agents of owners, of property abutting public sidewalks have a duty to maintain sidewalks in good order and repair, creates a duty of care that runs to individual passersby. <br> <br>The Supreme Court held that the ad hoc duty of care approach in Banks was not applicable to this case because the defendants did not possess or control the sidewalk.&nbsp; The Supreme Court also held that consistent with previous jurisprudence, the municipal ordinance in question only established a duty of care to the town of New Shoreham, not to individuals.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment. <br></div></td></tr><tr><td class="ms-vb-tall" colspan="1"><a onfocus="OnLink(this)" href="/Courts/SupremeCourt/Opinions/195,359.pdf" onmousedown="return VerifyHref(this,event,'1','','')" onclick="return DispEx(this,event,'TRUE','FALSE','FALSE','','1','','','','','-1','1','0','0x3000031041')"></a></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><img src="/_layouts/images/blank.gif" width="100%" height="4" alt=""></td></tr><tr class="ms-alternating ms-newsletteralt"><td class="ms-vb2"><a target="_blank" href="12-125.pdf"><span class="style1">Eddie M.
